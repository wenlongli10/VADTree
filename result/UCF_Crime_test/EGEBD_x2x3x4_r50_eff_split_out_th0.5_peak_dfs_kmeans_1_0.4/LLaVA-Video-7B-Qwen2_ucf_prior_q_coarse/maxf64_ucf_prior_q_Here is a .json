crowds) and physical damage (broken doors, smoke/flames).\n2. **Characters/Objects**: Focuses on suspicious individuals (masked/armed) or high-risk objects (weapons/flammables).\n3. **Actions/Behaviors**: Describes intense or abnorma actions (weapon swinging, rapid fleeing), critical for\nlow-quality\nvideo analysis.\n\n### **Tips for Low-Quality Video Recognition**\n• **Blurry Footage**: Prioritize **group behavior sudden change** (e.g., fleeing crowds) and **object trajectories** (explosion\ndebris).\n• **Long-Distance Scenes**: Rely on **environmental damage dynamics** (shattering glass, spreading smoke) and **large-scale conflicts** (fights/robberies).\n• **Silent Videos**: Infer anomalies via **action intensity** (repeated hitting, vehicle rollovers) and **object interactions** (throwing incendiaries, lock-picking).\n\nThis consolidated table serves as a prior knowledge base for video anomaly detection systems, improving accuracy through multi-dimensional feature combinations.\n\nPlease describe the content in the video in detail.",
